				<h2 class="major">Rules</h2>

				<h3 class="major">Game Objective</h3>
				<span>There are 2 opposing teams within the game:</span>
				<div class="side good">
					<h3>Kingdom of Valand</h3>
					As a Loyal servants of Valand&apos;s, your team will win if 3 out of 5 quests are successfully completed.
				</div>
				<div class="side evil">
					<h3>Erador Clan</h3>
					As the Eradors, your team will win if 3 out of 5 quests ends in failure. <br />
					Erador Clan can also win by assassinating Eldridge at the end of the game (when both Eldridge and Asellus
					are
					used during the play).
				</div>

				<hr />

				<h3 class="major">Identity</h3>
				<p>
					Inside the game you will be assigned a random character. Make sure to check your character at the start of
					the
					game so that you know which side you are on, and the special abilities you can do.
				</p>
				<p>
					To check your character click on the &quot;<b>SPECIAL</b>&quot; button located on the bottom right corner
					of
					your screen
				</p>
				<p>Please Note: in a 4 players game, Eldridge and Hugo will not be available.</p>

				<hr />
				<h3 class="major">Game Play</h3>
				<p>The game are composed of 5 rounds. Each rounds is divided into 3 phases:</p>

				<h3>Team Assignment Phase</h3>
				<p>
					The leader proposes a team to complete a quest. Each player will take turn to be the leader through out the
					rounds.
				</p>

				<h3>Voting Phase</h3>
				<p>
					Once team has been selected by the leader, all players will have to vote either to <b><u>approve</u></b> the
					proposed team or <b><u>reject</u></b> the proposed team. To get approved, the majority should approve the
					proposed team; a draw is considered as rejection. When approved, the proposed team will go to the quest phase,
					otherwise the leadership is passed on to the next player and repeating the process until a team is approved.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><u>When 5 consecutive rejections are made, the Erador Clan will win the game automatically</u></b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Eldridge may use voting phase to help Valands people, but becareful not to become too obvious as Asellus might
					be able to assasinate at the end of the game
				</p>

				<h3>Quest Phase</h3>
				<p>
					Those players selected in the approved team will determine if the Quest is successfull. One failure submission
					is enough to failed the Quest except on the 4th Quest (and only the 4th quest) in games of 7 or more players,
					it will require at least 2 failures quest submission to be considered as a failed Quest.
				</p>
				<p>After each quest completion, voting track is reset.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Becareful, Erador&apos;s player may submit a successful quest as a disguise</b>
				</p>

				<hr />
				<h3 class="major">End Game</h3>
				<p>
					The game will end immediately after 3 successful or 3 failed quests; or when 5 consecutive rejections occurs.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the event where Kingdom of Valand wins the game and Asellus is in the game, there will be a last chance for
					the Erador Clan. The game will enter in <b><u>Assassination Phase</u></b>
				<h3>Assassination Phase</h3>
				<p>
					Asellus may take this opportunity to discuss with his team mates to guess who is Eldridge. If Asellus guesses
					right, Erador Clan wins the game.
